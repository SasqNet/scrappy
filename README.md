# Advanced Web Scraper

This is a Python-based advanced web scraping application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The application allows users to scrape specific data from a single page or crawl an entire website, optionally focusing on collecting internal links. The app is highly interactive, providing real-time verbose output and results displayed side by side.

## Features

- **Single Page Scraping:** Scrape data from a single web page based on specified HTML tags, classes, and attributes.
- **Website Crawling:** Crawl an entire website to extract data from multiple pages.
- **Link Collection Mode:** Option to crawl the site and collect all internal links without scraping any data.
- **Real-time Progress:** Verbose output shows the progress of the scraping/crawling process in real time.
- **Stop Functionality:** Interrupt the ongoing scan with a responsive "Stop Scan" button.
- **Export Options:** Save the scraped data or collected links to CSV or JSON format.
- **Clear Results:** Clear both the results and verbose output with a single click.
- **Copy Results:** Easily copy data from the results using `Ctrl+C`.
